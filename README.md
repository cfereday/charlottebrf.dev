A website to share more about my work as a developer.

Started using the ```gatsby-starter-typescript-plus``` starter kit, then customised.

## Features

- TypeScript
- ESLint (with custom ESLint rules)
- Basic component structure
- Styling with [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started)

## Testing

- Jest
- React Testing Library


## Developing

# ...or, for npm
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
npm start

# build for production
npm run build

# run locally
http://localhost:8000/

# build for production and push to gh-pages branch
npm run deploy
```

## Credits

Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - the blazing-fast static site generator for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
