# Readme

## What is this project all about?
A website to share more about my work as a developer.
This site is deployed with Netflify every time changes are pushed and can be found at [charlottebrf.dev](https://www.charlottebrf.dev/)

## How it's evolved over time
I ported over to 11ty in 2020 from the original Gatsby site. More explanation in [this issue](https://github.com/cfereday/charlottebrf.dev/issues/11).

## How to run locally
Get the dependencies `npm install`
Using [serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve)
Run `npm start`

## How to build
`npm run prod`
